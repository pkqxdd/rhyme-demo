# Hamilton Rhyme Scheme

Our project is built upon analyzing six different types of rhymes in songs: end rhymes, perfect rhymes, semi rhymes, head rhymes, identical rhymes, and pararhymes. Our algorithm analyzes a text file of the lyrics and utilizes the CMU pronunciation dictionary to break up the syllables of words into phonetic pronunciations. The algorithm then matches syllables that rhyme to their specific rhyme type and connects to a graphic user interface. We applied our hack to the rhyme scheme of "Hamilton" the Musical's song, "Alexander Hamilton", by Lin Manuel-Miranda because we knew the song had a variety of rhyme types for our algorithm to analyze. Our graphic user interface was built with VelocityJS, and shows the specific rhyme type of the current syllable of the song. We have built a fully functional algorithm and user-interface, and beyond the hackathon we intend to apply our code to analyze a variety of songs and create an algorithm to find the time stamps between syllables so we don't have to manually enter them and can generalize our code for a multitude of songs.
